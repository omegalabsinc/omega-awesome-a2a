# Add MM-REACT: Advanced Multimodal Reasoning System

## Resource Overview
MM-REACT introduces a groundbreaking paradigm for AI-to-AI collaboration, enabling large language models to coordinate with specialized vision models for complex visual reasoning tasks. This system transcends traditional multimodal integration by implementing a novel prompt design that allows seamless information flow between different AI experts.

## Technical Innovation
```python
# Example implementation showcasing MM-REACT's core interaction pattern
from mm_react import MMReactSystem, VisionExperts

def multimodal_reasoning_pipeline():
    # Initialize system with vision expert pool
    system = MMReactSystem(
        llm="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        vision_experts={
            "object_detector": VisionExperts.DETECTOR,
            "scene_analyzer": VisionExperts.SCENE,
            "spatial_reasoner": VisionExperts.SPATIAL
        }
    )
    
    # Structured prompt for cross-model communication
    response = system.process(
        visual_input="scene.jpg",
        prompt_template={
            "task_description": str,
            "spatial_coordinates": List[Tuple],
            "visual_signals": Dict[str, bytes],
            "reasoning_chain": List[str]
        }
    )
    
    return response.reasoning_path, response.conclusions


# Add MM-REACT: Novel A2A Expert Collaboration Framework

## Overview
MM-REACT introduces a transformative approach to A2A communication by implementing a structured expert collaboration system between ChatGPT and specialized vision models. Unlike traditional multimodal systems, it enables dynamic interaction between AI models through an innovative prompt design that coordinates multiple expert systems for complex visual reasoning tasks.

## Technical Implementation
```python
from mm_react.system import MMReactSystem
from mm_react.experts import ExpertPool
from mm_react.prompts import StructuredPrompt

class MMReactPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expert_pool = ExpertPool([
            'object_detection',
            'scene_understanding',
            'spatial_reasoning'
        ])
        
        self.prompt_handler = StructuredPrompt(
            coordinate_format="<box>{x1,y1,x2,y2}</box>",
            visual_reference="<ref>image_id</ref>"
        )
    
    def process_visual_task(self, image, task):
        # Initialize expert consultation chain
        experts = self.expert_pool.select_relevant(task)
        
        # Structured information exchange between models
        expert_observations = []
        for expert in experts:
            observation = expert.analyze(image)
            expert_observations.append(
                self.prompt_handler.format_observation(observation)
            )
            
        # Coordinate findings through language model
        final_response = self.llm_coordinator.synthesize(
            expert_observations,
            task_context=task
        )
        
        return final_response
