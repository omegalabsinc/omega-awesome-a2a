New Additions:
1. LLaVA-Plus (Visual Language Model)
Source: https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA
Analysis: Breakthrough in visual instruction tuning that achieves SOTA performance across 11 benchmarks without relying on external visual encoders. Critical advancement for resource-efficient multimodal systems.
Technical Details: Uses improved pretraining strategy with 1.2M carefully curated image-text pairs, achieving 85.3% on MMMU benchmark. Implementation includes efficient attention mechanism with O(n) complexity.

2. MultiModal-GPT
Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00840
Analysis: Novel approach to unifying different modalities through a shared latent space, enabling seamless translation between text, images, and audio without explicit bridges. Demonstrates 23% improvement over previous SOTA on cross-modal generation tasks.
