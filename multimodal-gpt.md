# MultiModal-GPT: Vision-Language Dialogue Model

## Overview
A pioneering open-source multimodal model enabling context-aware dialogue with simultaneous image and text processing capabilities. Implements a novel temporal understanding architecture for maintaining dialogue context across multiple turns.

## Key Features
- Unified transformer architecture with temporal awareness
- Context preservation across multiple dialogue turns
- Open-source implementation with practical deployment examples
- Efficient cross-modal attention mechanism

## Technical Implementation
```python
from mmgpt.model import MultiModalGPT
from mmgpt.processor import ImageProcessor

# Initialize model and processor
model = MultiModalGPT.from_pretrained("openmmlab/MultiModal-GPT-v1")
processor = ImageProcessor()

# Example usage
image = processor.load_image("example.jpg")
response = model.generate(
    image=image,
    prompt="What's happening in this image?",
    max_length=100
)
