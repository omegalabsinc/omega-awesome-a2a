## Summary
This paper introduces Constitutional AI (CAI), a framework for developing AI systems that can make and keep promises about their behavior. The work addresses key challenges in AI alignment and safety by creating systems with reliable, predictable behaviors.

## Key Points
- Introduces methods for training AI systems to follow specific behavioral constitutions
- Discusses techniques for promise-keeping in AI systems
- Explores practical implementation approaches
- Examines theoretical foundations of constitutional training
